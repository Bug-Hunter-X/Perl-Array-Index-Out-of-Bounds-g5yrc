This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version. The error is silent, it doesn't throw an exception, and usually results in unexpected behavior. The solution involves checking array bounds before accessing elements.
